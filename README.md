Med Study Guide for College of Redwoods Paramedic Class

Hello future paramedic,

I created this program to help study Paramedic and home medications for CR paramedic class in 2022. This gives good options for studying paramedic medications and that part is complete. I had ideas to expand it to help with learning assessment, scenarios and radio reports but that is a much larger project, so ignore those parts for now. Contact me or tell Kelly to contact me if you find any issues or bugs and I can work on them. Or comment here.

If you want to download the executable files I have created a dropbox because github does not do well with large files.

If you feel the need to thank me in more than words please donate to [Petrolia Volunteer Fire Department](petroliafire.org). This department was how I got started and is an rural department with limited funding, so even small donations help a lot.

Now for nerdy stuff, this uses Godot engine 3.5 which was cutting edge at the time. Upgrading it to 4.0+ would take lots of work for little benifit. The structure of it may be weird if you want to edit things, so best to ask me or collaborate with me. I never planned on working with others or making this open source, I wasn't even sure I would share the executable program with others at first so documentation is basically nonexistant. I know bad way to code, but don't worry it barely causes headaches every time I work on it. Still here? Well the structure is to use globals with all the data and dictionaries so that eventually we can grab from all the different items and smash them together when creating the scenarios. Everything else is done through scenes. The theme is one global theme, so if you don't like it let me know. I went with blue because medical is blue, I really am not good at graphic design. Everything else is just trying to do DRY programming but often not and trial and error. Nothing is sacred in my program so feel free to start a branch and edit it, I would like to see what people come up with.

Sincerely,
Tyler
